<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Curtain Avenue is an innovative Flutter-based mobile application designed to introduce users to the world of coding through a unique interactive experience. In this application, users will embark on a journey as they navigate through a virtual city, controlling the movement of a character through a series of challenges.

The core concept of Curtain Avenue revolves around using a block-based programming system to plan the character's route. Instead of traditional lines of code, users will use a drag-and-drop system that employs visual blocks of statements, making coding concepts more accessible and engaging for beginners.

The application utilizes Firebase as its backend, providing a seamless integration of data storage and real-time updates. This allows for a robust and scalable infrastructure to support the game's features and user interactions.

### Features

1. `Create Order`: User can add their details like name , number and Etc. and get types to select Curtains.

2. `Users & Roles`: In this feature Admin can add their membes and define theirs roles with members details.
